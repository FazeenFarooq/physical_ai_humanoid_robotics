# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course**, a comprehensive 13-week program designed to teach students how to develop embodied AI systems that integrate perception, planning, navigation, manipulation, and conversation capabilities.

## Course Overview

This course follows a simulation-first methodology with progression to physical hardware, emphasizing:

- **ROS 2** as the communication framework
- **NVIDIA Isaac** for AI processing on edge hardware
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** cognitive stack integration
- **Sim-to-Real** transfer methodologies
- **Safety and Ethics** in robotics applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2 communication patterns
- Create high-fidelity simulation environments with Gazebo and Isaac Sim
- Deploy AI models for real-time perception and decision making
- Integrate multiple AI modalities (vision, language, action) into cohesive systems
- Transfer learned behaviors from simulation to physical hardware
- Implement safety protocols for autonomous robot operation

## Course Structure

The course is organized into 6 core modules:

1. **ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System** - Distributed communication and coordination
2. **Digital Twin** - Simulation environments for safe development and testing
3. **NVIDIA Isaac AI Brain** - Edge computing for real-time operation
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrated perception and action systems
5. **Humanoid Locomotion & Manipulation** - Complex robot movement and dexterity
6. **Conversational Robotics** - Natural human-robot interaction

## Prerequisites

Students should have:

- Proficiency in Python programming
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Some experience with Git version control

## Getting Started

To begin working with the course materials:

1. Follow the [Quickstart Guide](./quickstart.md) to set up your development environment
2. Review the [Research Methodology](./research/methodology.md) for conducting reproducible experiments
3. Explore the [Hardware Integration](./hardware/) documentation for physical robot operations
4. Begin with the [ROS 2 fundamentals](./modules/ros2_robust_nervous_system/) module

## Safety and Ethics

Throughout the course, students must adhere to safety protocols documented in the [Safety Guidelines](./safety/) section and follow ethical guidelines for AI and robotics development.

## Technical Requirements

- **Workstation**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with RTX GPU (4090 or equivalent recommended)
- **Robot Platform**: Unitree H1 Humanoid or TurtleBot 4
- **Simulation**: Gazebo Garden and NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- **AI Frameworks**: PyTorch 2.0+, CUDA 12.2
