# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text

```
Using the previously defined constitution, generate a complete SPECIFICATION.md for the course: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" This specification must define WHAT is built, taught, and delivered — not how. Include the following sections: 1. COURSE SCOPE - Target learner profile - Prerequisites (AI, ML, Python, Linux) - Expected competency at graduation 2. MODULE SPECIFICATIONS For each module, specify: - Objective - Inputs (software, hardware, knowledge) - Outputs (artifacts, skills, working systems) Modules: - ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System - Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity) - NVIDIA Isaac AI Brain - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Humanoid Locomotion & Manipulation - Conversational Robotics 3. SOFTWARE STACK (EXACT) - ROS 2 distro - Gazebo / Isaac Sim versions - Python, CUDA, TensorRT - LLM integration points 4. HARDWARE TIERS - Digital Twin Workstation (RTX-based) - Edge AI Kit (Jetson Orin) - Robot Lab options (Proxy, Mini Humanoid, Premium) 5. CAPSTONE SYSTEM SPEC Define the final autonomous humanoid system in terms of: - Perception - Planning - Navigation - Manipulation - Conversation - Failure recovery 6. MEASURABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA - What constitutes "working" - Performance benchmarks - Sim-to-real validation rules Write in a precise, engineering-spec tone. This document should be suitable for investors, lab builders, and accreditation bodies.
```

## Response Text

Complete specification document created at `specs/001-physical-ai-course/spec.md` with all required sections:

1. Course Scope (target learner profile, prerequisites, expected competency)
2. Module Specifications (6 modules with objectives, inputs, outputs)
3. Software Stack (exact versions and technologies)
4. Hardware Tiers (Digital Twin, Edge AI, Robot Lab options)
5. Capstone System Specification (perception, planning, navigation, etc.)
6. Measurable Success Criteria

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive specification for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course following the constitution principles. The specification is suitable for investors, lab builders, and accreditation bodies as requested.
